<h1 align="center"> Json Diff </h1>

This Java code is an implementation for comparing differences between two JSON files using the Jackson, Zjsonpatch, and Java NIO libraries. It can be used to identify and display specific differences between two JSON files.

For better visualization of the differences between the files, the code utilizes the Gson library to format the object into a well-indented and spaced JSON string.

This implementation is useful for comparing two JSON files and identifying the differences between them, which can be particularly helpful in regression testing or analyzing changes in JSON files.
